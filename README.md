### Here's the Idea

I created two python scripts.

First: A search script for the library

Second: A library which will hoepfully contain as many Animes as possible.

__This means:__
- Everyone can contribute to this library which for now asks for a name and a link to a website where you can watch it.

- I will need your help to fill this library with as many Animes as possibe and to expand what it can do.

- - - -

#### What does it include for now:

- A class for Anime
- A basic Library framework making implementation of new Anime easier
- A Search script for the library

- - - -

#### Future Tasks

- [ ] __Increase the paramaters of the Anime class to include a description, a date of release, the rating of the Anime and more__

- [ ] __Create Classes for Hentai, Manga, Manhwa and Self Published works to increase the scope of the library to as many people as possible__

- [ ] __Improve the Search Engine to be more user friendly__

- [ ] __Increase the actual library__

- [ ] __Improve the README to be better and more lively__

This is an open source project open to anyone who wants to contribute.

### ___DO NOT INPUT ANY MALICIOUS CODE OR LINKS___

A big thanks to anyone who contributes and to anyone who uses this since I hope that this tool
becomes useful to as many people as possible
